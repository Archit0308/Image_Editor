# Image_Editor
I made an image editor which is a software tool used to manipulate digital images. It allows you to modify, enhance, and create images with a variety of features.

An image editor with brightness, saturation, inversion, grayscale methods, and the ability to rotate images and upload and save them on your system is a software tool that allows you to manipulate digital images. These features provide a wide range of options to modify the appearance of an image, including changing the brightness or saturation to make it more vivid, inverting the colors to create a negative image, or converting it to grayscale.

Additionally, rotating an image can adjust its orientation to better suit your needs, such as flipping a portrait image to a landscape view. The ability to upload and save images on your system provides you with the flexibility to access and edit them at any time. It also has a reset filter feature that allows you to quickly undo any changes made and return the image to its original state. This can be helpful if you make an unwanted change or want to start over without having to manually adjust the settings back to their default values.
